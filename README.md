Name of all the Models and which files they are stored in:
- Basics.ipynb: Covers all the basics of creating and running ML models in sci-kit learn
- Ensemble.ipynb: Includes the ensembled models. The save files for these models can be found in /Main/Saved Models
- RandomForest_V4.ipynb: Random Forest Model, which was much more complex to create than basic ones
- Demo.ipynb: Includes the Demo of the Final Ensembled Model

We want to thank the entire Deloitte team for providing us this opportunity and continuously supporting us throughout the project.
