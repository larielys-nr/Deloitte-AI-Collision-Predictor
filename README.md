# AI for Space Traffic Management

This repository is a personal fork of a team project developed as part of the **Space Industry Entrepreneurship** course at UC Berkeley in Spring 2024.

The project explores the use of ensemble machine learning models (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net) to predict satellite collision risk using publicly available orbital tracking data (TLEs). It was guided by course instructors and mentors from Deloitte.

## My Role

While the original repository was developed collaboratively by my team, I forked this project to:
- Deepen my understanding of the machine learning models we used
- Learn Git and GitHub workflows
- Explore the structure and logic of the codebase through self-guided experimentation

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to my teammates and our Deloitte mentors for their work and collaboration. This project was completed in an academic setting and is for educational purposes only.
