# Deloitte-AI-Collision-Predictor
This is a Project in partnership with Deloitte as a part of the club NewSpace@Berkeley. 
Creating an AI Algorithm to predict collisions of objects in space.

Please check the [this file](Deloitte_%20AI%20Project%20Descprition.pdf) for the full project descriiption.

Name of all the Models and links to them:
- [Basics](Basics.ipynb): Covers all the basics of creating and running ML models in sci-kit learn
- [Ensemble](Ensemble.ipynb): Includes the ensembled models. The save files for models used in the ensemble can be found in [here](Model%20Files)
- [Random Forest](RandomForest_V4.ipynb): Random Forest Model, which was much more complex to create than basic ones
- [Demo](Demo.ipynb): Includes the Demo of the Final Ensembled Model
- Other Models:
  -  [Lasso](Model%20Files/Lasso_v2.ipynb)
  -  [Elastic Net](Model%20Files/ElasticNet.ipynb)
  -  [Linear Regression](Model%20Files/Regression.ipynb)
  -  [Ridge Regression](Model%20Files/Ridge_Regression(L2)-V2.ipynb)

We want to thank the entire Deloitte team for providing us this opportunity and continuously supporting us throughout the project.
